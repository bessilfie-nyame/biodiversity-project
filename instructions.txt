Create a Slide Deck - 1
Once you’ve performed your analysis, either on your computer or on Codecademy, you’re ready to create your slide deck. One of the most important parts of Data Analysis is being able to communicate your findings.

Create a slide deck using Google Drive, Microsoft Powerpoint, or some other presentation software. Your presentation should include the following:

A title slide
A section describing the data in species_info.csv. Be sure to include some (or all) of what you noticed while working through the notebook.
A section describing the significance calculations that you did for endangered status between different categories of species.
A recommendation for conservationists concerned about endangered species, based on your significance calculations
A section describing the sample size determination that you did for the foot and mouth disease study
All of the graphs that you created in the notebook
If you like, you can also record a video of yourself giving the presentation and upload it to YouTube.
